Build an image for a sample web application from a docker file using various docker file instructions
To perform this experiment we will use https://labs.play-with-docker.com/

Once your session is active click on “Add New Instance”:

A new instance will start with a Docker Engine ready to accept commands image

Next create/edit the Dockerfile. Run “vi Dockerfile”, press “i” to switch to “Insert Mode”, copy/paste the contents of our Dockerfile, press “Esc” to exit “Insert Mode”, and save+exit by typing “:x” image

Build the new image using the command docker build . Path refers to the directory containing the Dockerfile. image

At the end of the process you should see the message “Successfully built ” image

Start the new image and test connectivity to NGINX. Run the command

docker run -d -p 80:80 <image ID>
The option -p 80:80 exposes the Container port 80 as the Host port 80 to the world image

As a result a port 80 link should have become active next to the IP. Click on it to access your NGINX service image
