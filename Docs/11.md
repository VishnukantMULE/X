Managing Application Source Code with Git
Git version control features a branching model to track code changes. A branch is a named reference to a particular sequence of commits

All Git repositories have a base branch named master. By default, when you create a commit in your repository, the master branch is updated with the new commit

cd to the directory where you want to create a new repository and initialize it with git

git init
when changes are made to the files in the repository, you can see the changes by using the git status command

git status
To add changes to the staging area, use the git add command

git add .
To commit changes to the repository, use the git commit command

git commit -m "commit message"
To view the commit history, use the git log command

git log
By convention, the master branch in a Git repository contains the latest, stable version of the application source code. To implement a new feature or functionality, create a new branch from the master branch. This new branch, called a feature branch, contains commits corresponding to code changes for the new feature. The master branch is not affected by commits to the feature branch.

To create a new branch, use the git branch command

git branch feature1
To switch to the new branch, use the git checkout command

git checkout feature1
To create a new branch and switch to it, use the git checkout -b command

git checkout -b feature1
To merge the feature branch into the master branch, use the git merge command

git merge feature1
To delete a branch, use the git branch -d command

git branch -d feature1
To push changes to the remote repository, use the git push command

git push
To pull changes from the remote repository, use the git pull command

git pull
